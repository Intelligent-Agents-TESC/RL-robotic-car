# Ultrasonic Sensor Data

For practical tasks with high dimensional state spaces in the context of reinforcement learning, employing the help of a simulator can offer a way to offset the cost of real-world interaction. Since our goal is to compare the real life and simulated performances of learning algorithms, a simulator that models the actual environment is needed. Our simulator is powered by VPythonâ€™s 3D modeling engine and modeled after the hexagonal arena that exists in the physical world. 

This dataset represents readings gather from the onboard ultrasonic sensor when agent is positioned to face the wall, specifically the origin point (green dot in grapic below) at various intervaled distances.
