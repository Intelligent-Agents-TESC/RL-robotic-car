# Simulator

For practical tasks with high dimensional state spaces in the context of reinforcement learning, employing the help of a simulator can offer a way to offset the cost of real-world interaction. Since our goal is to compare the real life and simulated performances of learning algorithms, a simulator that models the actual environment is needed. Our simulator is powered by VPythonâ€™s 3D modeling engine and modeled after the hexagonal arena that exists in the physical world. 

The simulator provides a way for the agent to interact with the environment backed by sensory and coordinate data collected in the physical environment. We divided the area with a 5x5 grid and collected data on a per coordinate basis. The data include ambient temperature, change in temperature, and light intensity. These data, used alongside the energy principle help inform a model for the heat lamp which is situated at the center of the arena.
